   <h2>Games</h2>
   <p><b>1.</b> All games will be played at Horn (except for the All-Star game).</p>
   <p><b>2.</b> Each game will be 6 innings long (unless there are extra innings).</p>

   <hr />
   <h2>Ground Rules</h2>
   <p><b>1.</b> Errors are given to throws that travel out of the cage. If the ball hits the pitcher's hand, it's an error on the pitcher, otherwise it's an error on the thrower.</p>
   <p><b>2.</b> If a ball gets stuck in the trailer steps, it's a single for the closest one and a double for the farthest one.</p>
   <p><b>3.</b> If a ball goes in and out of the fire escape then it's an automatic single.</p>
   <p><b>4.</b> If the ball hits the window on the roof, it's a home run, but if it hits the chimney then it's a live ball.</p>
   <p><b>5.</b> If a ball gets stuck on the roof then it is still considered a home run, not an out.</p>
   <hr />
